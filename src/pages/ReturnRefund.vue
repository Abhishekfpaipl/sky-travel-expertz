                            <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Refund often specifies the conditions under which a refund
                                is eligible. This could include cancellations within a certain time frame or under
                                specific circumstances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refund Process:</strong> The process for obtaining a refund is usually outlined,
                                including the steps you need to take and any supporting documentation required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partial Refunds:</strong> In some cases, we may offer partial refunds depending
                                on the timing or specific conditions of the cancellation.</li>
